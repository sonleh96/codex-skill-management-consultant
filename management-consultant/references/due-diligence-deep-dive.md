# Due Diligence Deep Dive: M&A & Investment Analysis

## 1. Commercial Due Diligence (CDD) Framework

### Definition & Scope

Commercial Due Diligence assesses the commercial attractiveness and viability of a target business. It answers: "Is this business worth what we think it's worth, and what are the revenue and margin risks?"

CDD focuses on **top-line** sustainability and growth:
- Market size and growth trends
- Customer concentration and retention
- Competitive positioning and barriers to entry
- Pricing power and margin sustainability
- Sales funnel health and pipeline quality
- Product-market fit and go-to-market efficiency

### Market & Customer Analysis

**Market Assessment:**
- Total Addressable Market (TAM): Top-down (industry research) and bottom-up (customer counts × average contract value)
- Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM): Realistic addressable portion within 3-5 years
- Market Growth Rate: CAGR from credible sources (IDC, Gartner, PitchBook for private companies)
- Competitive Intensity: Number and scale of competitors; market consolidation trends
- Barriers to Entry: Switching costs, network effects, regulatory moats, brand value

**Customer Due Diligence:**
- **Customer Concentration:** % revenue from top 10 customers (red flag if >40%)
- **Customer Retention:** Churn rate, customer lifetime value (LTV), repeat purchase rates
- **Customer Concentration by Segment:** Industrial customers vs. consumer; enterprise vs. SMB
- **Contract Terms:** Average contract length, renewal rates, gross retention, net retention (expansion revenue)
- **Net Revenue Retention (NRR):** For SaaS, the gold standard metric: (Beginning ARR + Expansion - Churn) / Beginning ARR. >100% is very strong; <90% signals risk

### Sales & Marketing Analysis

**Go-to-Market Efficiency:**
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): Fully loaded marketing + sales expense per new customer
- CAC Payback Period: Months to recover CAC from gross profit; <12 months is strong for B2B
- Sales Force Productivity: Revenue per sales rep; benchmark against peer group
- Pricing Strategy: List price vs. effective price; discounting trends; pricing power vs. competitors
- Marketing Mix: Direct sales vs. channel vs. self-serve; cost by channel

**Sales Pipeline Health:**
- Pipeline visibility: Forecast accuracy (compare past projections to actuals)
- Win rates by customer segment and competitor
- Sales cycle length: Days from lead to close; trends over time (lengthening suggests deal quality risk)

### Pricing & Margin Analysis

**Pricing Power:**
- Historical price increases (absolute and %)
- Price elasticity: How do customers respond to price moves?
- Competitive pricing: How does target pricing vs. incumbents?
- Switching costs: Low switching costs = low pricing power

**Margin Sustainability:**

## 7. PE vs. Strategic Acquirer Due Diligence

### Private Equity (PE) Approach

**Financial Engineering Focus:**
- Deeply analyze EBITDA adjustments: Every add-back is scrutinized; will it survive LBO scrutiny?
- Leverage capacity: How much debt can this business support? Model 6-8 leverage, debt paydown schedule
- Exit multiples: At what multiple will we exit? 5-7 year hold period
- Cash-on-cash returns: Target 20-30% IRR; model multiple exit scenarios

**Operational Value Creation:**
- Identify 100-150 bps of EBITDA margin expansion: SG&A rationalization, procurement optimization, pricing actions
- Benchmark operations against best-in-class: Can we drive efficiency to peer levels?
- Management alignment: Will sellers/management stay? Rollover equity to align incentives
- Add-on acquisition targets: Can we bolt on complementary businesses to drive revenue growth?

**Key PE Red Flags:**
- Unsustainable EBITDA: Dependent on owner's unpaid labor or one-time events
- Debt service risk: Operating leverage too high; negative working capital
- Customer concentration: Can't support leverage with concentrated customer base
- Management risk: Key person dependencies; management staying only for retention bonus

### Strategic Acquirer Approach

**Strategic Fit Analysis:**
- Synergy identification: Revenue synergies (cross-sell, market access), cost synergies (procurement, manufacturing footprint, G&A)
- Quantify synergies: Model revenue uplift, integration cost savings, capex reductions
- Cost of integration: Time, resources, disruption to both companies
- Risk of integration: Customer/employee churn, cultural clash, execution risk

**Competitive & Market Positioning:**
- Competitive advantage: Does acquisition strengthen market position vs. competitors?
- Market share impact: Combined market share post-acquisition; regulatory clearance risk (FTC)
- Synergy capture: Can we actually realize cost synergies without losing revenue?
- Speed to market: Does acquisition accelerate product roadmap or market entry vs. organic development?

**Key Strategic Red Flags:**
- Modest synergies relative to purchase price: Overpay risk
- Integration complexity: Different systems, cultures, customer bases; high implementation risk
- Regulatory risk: Antitrust concerns; deal approval uncertain
- Seller retention: Key customers prefer old management; revenue at risk

### Financial Model Differences

| Aspect | PE | Strategic |
|---|---|---|
| **Valuation Floor** | Debt capacity (EBITDA / target leverage) | Synergies + standalone DCF |
| **Return Target** | 20-30% IRR | Revenue/strategic value + cost savings |
| **Working Capital** | Optimize (lower DPO = less cash) | Manage per integration plan |
| **Leverage** | Maximize (use debt for returns) | Moderate (financial flexibility) |
| **Exit** | Trade sale or IPO in 5-7 years | Integrate and hold indefinitely |

## Key Takeaways for Practitioners

1. **CDD is valuation intelligence:** Every $1 of risk identified can inform $5–$10 of valuation adjustment.
2. **Red flag investigation beats checkboxes:** Deep-dive on top 3–5 risks; confirm with primary research.
3. **NRR and CAC payback are gold standards:** For B2B software, NRR >100% and CAC payback <12 months indicate quality.
4. **Quality of earnings matters more than headline EBITDA:** Scrutinize every add-back; conservative FDD saves money later.
5. **Tech DD increasingly material:** Software/IP now core to valuation for most acquirers; allocate accordingly.
6. **ESG red flags are real:** Regulatory fines, litigation, supply chain risk are quantifiable and growing.
7. **PE vs. Strategic due diligence is fundamentally different:** Align workplan scope to buyer type and deal thesis.
8. **Vendor DD extends beyond deal close:** Ongoing contract management and monitoring reduce operational surprises.
9. **Parallel workstreams compress timeline:** 10–12 week due diligence cycles standard for $100M–$500M deals.
10. **Integration planning starts in due diligence:** Best acquirers use DD to inform post-close 100-day plans and synergy realization.
